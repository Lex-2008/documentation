## User Management ##

![User Management](Settings-3.png)

User management is for adding or adjusting CFEngine Enterprise UI
users, including their name, role, and password.

## Role Management ##

![Role Management](Settings-role.png)

Roles are used to limit access. Roles can limit access for reporting on
hosts that have or do not have spcecific classes, and they can be used
to limit which sketches from Design Center a user is authorized to
use.

For example if you want to limit a users ability to report only on
hosts in the "North American Data Center" you could setup a role that
includes only the `location_nadc` class.

If you have multiple roles assigned to a user, the user can access
only hosts that match all of their role restrictions. For example, if
you have the admin role and a role that matches zero hosts, the user
will not see any hosts in Mission Portal.

Users without a role will not be able to see any hosts in Mission
Portal.

**Default Roles:**

* admin - The admin role can see everything and do anything.
* cf_remoteagent - This role allows execution of cf-runagent. It can
  be used from within Design Center to troubleshoot hosts that have
  failed sketch activations.

## Manage Apps ##

name.
